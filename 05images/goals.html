	<h1>Start Your Goals</h1>
	  <h2>Keep in Mind: All Body Types</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Set Realistic Goals: Start with achievable goals to build confidence and momentum.</li>
		<li>Create a Routine: Establish a regular schedule that includes workouts and meal planning.</li>
		<li>Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to support overall health and performance.</li>
		<li>Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how you feel and adjust your workouts accordingly to avoid injury</li>
		<li>Find Support: Join fitness communities, find a workout buddy, or consider working with a personal trainer for motivation and guidance.</li>
			</ul> 
		<h2>What's Your Body Type?</h2>
		   <h3>Lean with Fast Metablism (Ectomorph)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Focus on Strength Training: Prioritize weightlifting to build muscle mass. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are effective</li>
			<li>Increase Caloric Intake: Consume more calories with a balanced diet rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.</li>
			<li>Limit Cardio: Keep cardio sessions short and infrequent to avoid burning too many calories. Aim for 1-2 times a week.</li>
			<li>Stay Consistent: Track your progress and stick to a routine to see improvements over time.</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Muscular with Athletic Build (Mesomorph)</h3>
		 <ul>
		  <li>Balanced Training: Incorporate both strength training and cardio into your routine. A mix of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate weightlifting works well.</li>
		  <li>Nutrition Awareness: Maintain a balanced diet with an emphasis on protein, healthy fats, and carbs. Adjust portions based on your energy needs.</li>
		  <li>Set Clear Goals: Whether you want to bulk up or slim down, define your goals clearly and adjust your workout plan accordingly.</li>
		  <li>Stay Flexible: Adapt your routine as you progress. Mesomorphs often respond well to changes in workout intensity and volume.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>Higher Body Fat with Wider Frame/Curvier and Rounder</h3>
		<ul>
         <li>Focus on Fat Loss: Prioritize cardio workouts, including steady-state and HIIT, to help burn fat.</li>
		 <li>Strength Training: Incorporate resistance training to build lean muscle, which can help boost your metabolism</li>
		 <li>Monitor Diet Closely: Keep track of your caloric intake and focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods while reducing processed foods and sugars.</li>
		 <li>Consistency and Patience: Understand that changes may take time. Stay committed to your routine and make gradual adjustments.</li>
		</ul>
